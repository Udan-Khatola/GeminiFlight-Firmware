# GeminiFlight (forked from dRehmFlight)

Currently forked to use proper Git flow for development. Long term focus on developing serial control from a Raspberry Pi for extended autopilot ability in the software realm over the firmware realm.

## Overview on dRehmFlight

dRehmFlight is the flight controller for hobbyists, hackers, and non-coders interested in stabilizing their wacky and unique flying creations. The code and supporting documentation is built to bring someone up to speed on VTOL flight stabilization concepts as quickly and painlessly as possible. The code is written and presented in a way that is intuitive, easy to follow, and most importantly: all in one place. No more digging through countless folders and confusing classes just to add an 'if' statement for your custom drone application. This flight controller uses an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, so there is no confusing flashing or compiling process necessary. If you can use Arduino, you can start expanding the capabilites of this flight controller to your liking.

dRehmFlight has been used as a teaching tool for aircraft stabilization and flight control principles in universities and tech companies around the world. It is not meant to out-perform other flight controller packages on the market, or be used in a commercial sense. It is best suited for rapid prototyping or allowing a radio control hobbyist to get their feet wet in flight control code for their VTOL project. Much more information is included in the dRehmFlight VTOL Documentation .pdf.

This code is entirely free to use and will stay that way forever. We haven't made enough modifications yet to accept any donations but if you found this helpful for your own project, please donate to the OG of dRehmFlight and tell him I sent you: [Paypal Donation](https://www.paypal.me/NicholasRehm)
